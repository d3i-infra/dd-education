# The Run Cycle

The data donation task is built on a **co-routine pattern**: Python and
JavaScript take turns. Python runs until it has something to show the
participant or something to send to the host, then it yields a command and
pauses. JavaScript handles the command, waits for a response (user interaction
or a host acknowledgement), and sends that response back to Python. Python
resumes with the response as the return value of the `yield`.

This alternation is the heartbeat of the whole system. Every UI interaction,
every log message, every donation — all of it goes through this cycle.

## Startup sequence

Before the first run cycle can happen, Pyodide must be loaded and the port
package installed. This takes several seconds on first load.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant MONO as Eyra mono
    participant SHC as ScriptHostComponent
    participant ASM as Assembly
    participant WPE as WorkerProcessingEngine
    participant WK as py_worker.js

    MONO->>SHC: postMessage live-init (MessagePort, locale)
    SHC->>ASM: LiveBridge.create() callback
    ASM->>WPE: processingEngine.start()
    WPE->>WK: postMessage initialise
    WK->>WK: loadPyodide()
    WK->>WK: loadPackage([micropip, numpy, pandas])
    WK->>WK: micropip.install(port-*.whl)
    WK->>WPE: postMessage initialiseDone
    WPE->>MONO: sendSystemEvent("initialized")
    WPE->>WK: postMessage firstRunCycle (sessionId, platform)
    WK->>WK: pyScript = port.start(sessionId, platform)
    WK->>WK: runCycle(null)
    WK->>WPE: postMessage runCycleDone (first command)
```

`port.start(sessionId, platform)` calls `main.start()`, which creates a
`ScriptWrapper` around `script.process()`. The `ScriptWrapper` is a Python
generator. `runCycle(null)` calls `pyScript.send(null)` — the first send to a
generator must pass `None`, which advances it to its first `yield`.

## The run cycle loop

After startup, every cycle follows the same pattern:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant WPE as WorkerProcessingEngine
    participant CR as CommandRouter
    participant RE as ReactEngine
    participant BR as Bridge
    participant WK as py_worker.js
    participant PY as Python (ScriptWrapper)

    WPE->>CR: onCommand(command)

    alt CommandUIRender
        CR->>RE: visualizationEngine.render(page)
        RE-->>CR: response (PayloadTrue/False/JSON/File)
        CR-->>WPE: response
    else CommandSystemDonate / CommandSystemLog / CommandSystemExit
        CR->>BR: bridge.send(command)
        BR-->>CR: response (PayloadVoid or PayloadResponse)
        CR-->>WPE: response
    end

    WPE->>WK: postMessage nextRunCycle (response)
    WK->>PY: pyScript.send(response.payload)
    PY-->>WK: next command (via yield)
    WK->>WPE: postMessage runCycleDone (command)
    WPE->>WPE: logger.flush()
```

The cycle ends when Python raises `StopIteration` (the generator is
exhausted), at which point `ScriptWrapper.send()` returns
`CommandSystemExit(0, "End of script")`.

## File handling in the worker

When the user selects a file, the response payload is `PayloadFile`, which
contains a browser `File` object. Browser `File` objects cannot be passed
directly into Python — they live in the JS thread and Python runs in the
worker thread.

The worker handles this in `unwrap()`:

1. JS sends `nextRunCycle` with `response.payload.__type__ == "PayloadFile"`
2. `py_worker.js` wraps the `File` in a `FileReaderSync`-backed reader object
3. This reader is sent to Python as a `PayloadFile.value`
4. Python's `AsyncFileAdapter` wraps it, allowing synchronous `.read()` inside the worker
5. The adapter is passed directly to consumers (`zipfile.ZipFile`, validators,
   extractors) — the upload is streamed, never materialized to a path
   (ADR-0026). `uploads.check_payload_size()` enforces the size policy from
   JS-reported metadata before any bytes are read.

A platform whose file prompt sets `expected_file_payload = "PayloadFiles"`
(see [FlowBuilder](04-flowbuilder.md)) gets the same treatment per file,
never one bulk copy: the browser sends a `File[]`, `py_worker.js` maps each
one through the same reader-wrapping logic (`Array.map(createAsyncFileReader)`,
ADR-0017) into a `PayloadFiles.value` list, and `main.py` wraps each reader
in its own `AsyncFileAdapter`. `FlowBuilder.start_flow()` then unions those
adapters into one `ArchiveSet` (ADR-0040) before validation — see
[Extraction](05-extraction.md#multi-file-archives-archiveset).
