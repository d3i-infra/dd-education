# Error Handling

There are three categories of error in the system, each handled differently.
The dividing lines are chosen to protect participant PII.

---

## Upload-flow control paths — not Python exceptions

Two more failure paths live in `FlowBuilder.start_flow()` itself, before
extraction is ever reached. Neither is a caught exception in the sense of
the three categories below — both are ordinary branches in the generator's
control flow, and neither carries participant data.

**The protocol-error page.** Step 1's file-prompt gate is a three-way
branch on `file_result.__type__` versus `self.expected_file_payload`: the
exact match proceeds, the established decline shapes (`PayloadFalse` /
`PayloadVoid` / `PayloadString`, pinned by ADR-0026) end the flow silently
(as an abandonment — see below), and anything else — a genuine mismatch between what this build's host sends and
what this platform expects, i.e. version skew, not a decline — renders
`ph.render_protocol_error_page(platform_name)`: a visible page telling the
participant something went wrong with the upload step, distinct from the
"no data extracted" or "safety check failed" pages. This never happens in
normal operation; it exists so a version-skewed host doesn't hang the
participant on the file-select page forever with no explanation.

Neither branch is a completion. Both raise `TaskIncompleteError` —
`"abandoned"` for a decline, `"upload_rejected"` for a protocol mismatch —
so `ScriptWrapper` shows the task-incomplete page and exits nonzero, and
the host keeps the task pending instead of recording a donation-free
completion (ADR-0039). The same applies to the multi-file safety-error page
(`FileTooLargeError` / `TooManyFilesError`) and to declining the retry
prompt after a corrupt part.

**`ArchiveSet` construction failure → retry, not a traceback.** For a
multi-file platform (`expected_file_payload == "PayloadFiles"`),
`start_flow()` unions the uploaded parts with `ArchiveSet(parts)`, which
raises `zipfile.BadZipFile` if any single part isn't a readable zip. This is
caught at the call site and routed through the same `_prompt_retry()` helper
an invalid single file uses — the participant sees "Try again?", not an
uncaught-exception page. See [FlowBuilder](04-flowbuilder.md) for the full
three-way gate and the two causes that share `_prompt_retry()`, and ADR-0040
for `ArchiveSet` itself.

**File:** `packages/python/port/helpers/flow_builder.py`,
`packages/python/port/helpers/port_helpers.py`
(`render_protocol_error_page`)

---

## Category 1: Expected extraction errors

These are foreseeable failures during file parsing — a missing file in the
zip, a malformed CSV, an unexpected encoding. They are caught inside
`extract_data()`, counted by exception type, and reported as a summary after
extraction completes.

**How it works:**

1. `ZipArchiveReader` catches parsing exceptions internally and increments
   `errors[ExceptionType.__name__]` in the shared `Counter`
2. `extract_data()` returns `ExtractionResult(tables=..., errors=errors)`
3. `FlowBuilder.start_flow()` reads `result.errors` and formats the counts:
   `"errors: FileNotFoundInZipError×2, KeyError×1"`
4. This string is forwarded via `ph.emit_log()` → Path A → host

**What the host sees:** Exception type names and counts. No messages, no
tracebacks, no file contents.

**Where errors accumulate:** `packages/python/port/helpers/extraction_helpers.py`
(`ZipArchiveReader`) and in per-file functions in each platform module.

---

## Category 2: Uncaught Python exceptions — three defense layers

If an exception escapes `extract_data()` — or any other part of the script
generator — there are three layers of defense preventing it from reaching the
host unsanitised. Each layer catches what the previous one missed, with
decreasing PII protection.

### Layer 1: `ScriptWrapper` (Python) — consent-gated

The primary defense. `ScriptWrapper.send()` wraps every call to the script
generator in a try/except. If an exception escapes, it is caught in Python
and routed through `error_flow`.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["ScriptWrapper.send()\nmain.py"]
    B{"Exception\nescaped?"}
    C["traceback.format_exc()\ncaptured in Python only\nnever forwarded automatically"]
    D["self._error_handler =\nerror_flow(platform, tb)"]
    E["yield CommandUIRender\nconsent page shown to participant\n'Would you like to report this error?'"]
    F{"Participant\nconsents?"}
    G["yield CommandSystemDonate\nkey='error-report'\nvalue: platform + traceback + timestamp"]
    H["Sent via bridge\nreaches host as a donation payload"]
    I["CommandSystemExit(0)\nscript ends silently"]

    A --> B
    B -- yes --> C --> D --> E --> F
    F -- PayloadTrue --> G --> H
    F -- "PayloadFalse / skip" --> I
    B -- no --> Z["Normal command\nreturned to JS"]
```

**Key behaviours:**

- The traceback is shown to the participant on screen, so they can see what
  went wrong. It is not forwarded to the host without their explicit consent.
- If the participant consents, the traceback is donated as structured JSON to
  the key `"error-report"`.
- If the participant declines, the script ends silently — no error is recorded
  anywhere the host can see.
- Once `self._error_handler` is set, all subsequent `send()` calls are routed
  through `error_flow` until it completes.

**What the host sees:** Either nothing, or a full donation payload containing
the traceback — but only with consent.

**File:** `packages/python/port/main.py`

### Layer 2: `runCycle()` try/catch (JS worker) — shown on screen, not forwarded

If `ScriptWrapper` fails to catch the exception (e.g. a bug in `ScriptWrapper`
itself, or an error during Pyodide object conversion), it propagates into
`py_worker.js`. The `runCycle()` function has a try/catch that converts the
error into a `CommandUIRender` via `generateErrorMessage()`:

```javascript
// py_worker.js
function runCycle(payload) {
  try {
    scriptEvent = pyScript.send(payload);
    // ... post runCycleDone with command
  } catch (error) {
    self.postMessage({
      eventType: "runCycleDone",
      scriptEvent: generateErrorMessage(String(error)),
    });
  }
}
```

`generateErrorMessage()` constructs a `PropsUIPageDataSubmission` with the
error text. This is posted as a normal `runCycleDone` event, so it flows
through `CommandRouter` → `ReactEngine` and is **rendered on screen** — not
forwarded to the host via the bridge.

**PII note:** The traceback is shown directly to the participant via
`String(error)` with no consent gate. However, it does not reach the host —
the command is a `CommandUIRender`, not a `CommandSystemLog` or
`CommandSystemDonate`.

**File:** `packages/data-collector/public/py_worker.js`

> **Branch note:** This try/catch was added in commit `f0b77fa` (part of
> `integration/extraction-consolidation`), which builds on
> `integration/bridge-alignment`. It is not present in `bridge-alignment`
> itself — the Layer 2 defense is introduced in the next PR in the stack.

### Layer 3: `worker.onerror` (JS main thread) — limited to synchronous errors

`WorkerProcessingEngine` registers a `worker.onerror` handler:

```typescript
// worker_engine.ts
this.worker.onerror = (error) => {
  this.logger?.log('error', `Python error: ${error.message}`, {
    filename: error.filename,
    lineno: error.lineno,
    colno: error.colno,
  })
}
```

This logs to `LogForwarder`, which flushes immediately (error-level entries
trigger auto-flush), and the message reaches the host via
`LiveBridge.sendLogs()`.

**However, this only catches synchronous errors.** In `py_worker.js`, there
are two call sites for `runCycle()`:

- **`firstRunCycle`** — calls `runCycle(null)` synchronously from `onmessage`.
  If it throws, the error propagates synchronously → `worker.onerror` fires.
  This only happens once at startup.
- **`nextRunCycle`** — calls `runCycle(userInput)` inside a `.then()` callback.
  If it throws, the synchronous throw inside `.then()` becomes a **rejected
  promise**. There is no `.catch()`. This is an unhandled promise rejection
  in the worker's global scope — `worker.onerror` on the main thread does
  **not** fire for these. `WindowLogSource`'s `unhandledrejection` listener
  is on `window` (main thread), not the worker's global scope.

In practice, every run cycle after the first goes through `nextRunCycle`. So
for the common case, **an exception escaping both Layer 1 and Layer 2 would
be silently swallowed** — visible only in the worker's DevTools console,
never reaching `LogForwarder` or the host.

### Summary of the three layers

    LOST["nextRunCycle:\nunhandled promise rejection\nsilently lost in worker"]

    EX --> L1
    L1 -- yes --> EF
    L1 -- no --> L2
    L2 -- yes --> GEM
    L2 -- no --> L3
    L3 -- yes --> OE
    L3 -- no --> LOST
```

| Layer | Where | Consent? | Reaches host? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. `ScriptWrapper` | Python (main.py) | Yes — participant must opt in | Only if consented |
| 2. `runCycle()` catch | JS worker (py_worker.js) | No — shown on screen directly | No — rendered as UI, not logged |
| 3. `worker.onerror` | JS main thread (worker_engine.ts) | No | Only for `firstRunCycle` (synchronous); silently lost for `nextRunCycle` (promise rejection) |

---

## Category 3: JavaScript-side errors

Errors originating in JavaScript that are not caused by Python exceptions
never touch `ScriptWrapper` or `error_flow`. They go through
[Path B of the logging system](06-logging.md#path-b-js-logforwarder), but
only if they occur in the right scope:

| Error type | Where it fires | Reaches host? |
|---|---|---|
| Synchronous main-thread error | `WindowLogSource` `error` listener on `window` | Yes |
| Unhandled promise rejection on **main thread** | `WindowLogSource` `unhandledrejection` listener on `window` | Yes |
| Synchronous worker error | `worker.onerror` on main thread | Yes |
| Unhandled promise rejection **in worker** | Nothing — `window` listeners don't see worker-scope rejections | No — silently lost |

**What the host sees (when it reaches the host):** Error level log entries with
`level` and `message` only. The context fields captured by `WindowLogSource`
(memory usage, filename, line number) and the timestamp are dropped by
`LiveBridge.sendLogs()` and never reach the host.

**Scope gap:** `WindowLogSource` listens on `window` (main thread). The worker
has its own global scope. An unhandled promise rejection inside the worker
(e.g. an `unwrap()` failure in `py_worker.js`) does not bubble to the main
thread's `window` — it is invisible to `WindowLogSource` and `LogForwarder`.
This is the same gap that affects Layer 3 of Category 2: the worker has no
`self.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', ...)` handler.

---

## PII safety boundary

The architecture is designed so that raw exception text — which may contain
participant data (file paths, field values, etc.) — is never forwarded to the
host without consent.

| Path | Raw exception text reaches host? |
|---|---|
| `emit_log` (Path A) | No — counts and type names only |
| `error_flow` (Layer 1) | Only with explicit participant consent |
| `runCycle()` catch (Layer 2) | No — rendered on screen, not forwarded |
| `worker.onerror` (Layer 3, `firstRunCycle` only) | Yes — forwarded via `LogForwarder`, but only for the synchronous first cycle |
| Escaped exception in `nextRunCycle` | No — silently lost as unhandled promise rejection in worker |
| `LogForwarder` (Path B, main-thread JS errors) | Message only (context and timestamp dropped), no Python tracebacks under normal operation |
| Unhandled promise rejection in worker | No — silently lost; `WindowLogSource` listens on `window`, not worker scope |
| `logger.error(...)` (Python logging) | No — browser console only |

This boundary is documented in ADR ADR-0022. The critical design decisions are:

1. **`ScriptWrapper`** catches exceptions in Python before they can propagate
   to the JS engine. This is the primary defense and the only one with a
   consent gate.
2. **`runCycle()` try/catch** (Layer 2) prevents host forwarding if Layer 1
   fails, but shows the traceback to the participant without consent.
3. **`worker.onerror`** (Layer 3) is a narrow fallback — it only catches
   synchronous errors from `firstRunCycle`. For `nextRunCycle` (the common
   case), an exception escaping both Layer 1 and Layer 2 would be silently
   lost. This is arguably a safer failure mode (no PII leak to the host), but
   it means the error is invisible to everyone, including the researcher.
