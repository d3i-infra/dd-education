    Canonical part order is `(name, size)` — both JS-reported metadata, never
    selection order, never a byte read. Parts with identical name AND size are
    indistinguishable without reading bytes (which the pre-validation path
    forbids), so their relative order among themselves is unspecified (falls
    out of Python's stable sort over whatever order they were passed in).

    Duplicate paths are tracked in `self.duplicates` under two distinct keys,
    counted independently so neither inflates the other:
      - "DuplicateMemberAcrossParts": a path's first-in-canonical-order part
        wins; `read_member`/`part_index_of` resolve to that part.
      - "DuplicateMemberWithinPart": the zip format allows the same path to
        appear more than once inside a single part's central directory.
        We deliberately do not fight `zipfile` for first-entry semantics
        here (real exports show zero such duplicates; this is a defensive
        observability path) — a within-part duplicate path resolves to
        that part's *last* central-directory entry, i.e. plain Python
        `zipfile` semantics (`ZipFile.read`/`getinfo` on a repeated name).
