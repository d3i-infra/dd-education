Instagram

This module contains an example flow of a Instagram data donation study

Assumptions:
It handles DDPs in the english language with filetype JSON.

Timestamps
----------
Every date column is written as ``YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`` in the reference timezone named by
``extraction_helpers.REFERENCE_TIMEZONE``, so that a date means the same thing here as it
does in the TikTok, Facebook and Google tables.

The json export records epoch seconds, which name an absolute instant, so placing them in
that zone is exact.

The html export names no timezone, but it is not written in the timezone of the
participant either: it is rendered eight hours behind UTC, always. Knowing that offset is
what makes it convertible, so the two export formats now agree rather than sitting nine or
ten hours apart.

That offset was measured, not assumed. ``scripts/meta_html_timezone_probe.py`` matches
records held in both formats and reports the difference; run over two donated archives it
put every source at -8 — eight sources apiece, one archive reaching back to 2012, with no
exception anywhere. It is a *fixed* -8 rather than US Pacific, which it otherwise resembles:
records falling inside US daylight saving, where Pacific stands seven hours behind, are
eight hours behind here too, so no daylight saving rule of its own is needed.

It also belongs to Instagram rather than to the person. The Facebook export of those same
two accounts is on a different clock again — Amsterdam for one, UTC for the other — which
is why ``facebook.py`` cannot do the same thing and leaves its html clock alone.

Configuration
-------------
The ``extraction`` function is driven by ``port_config.json``.  Generate one with::

    pnpm generate-config instagram

Each extractor function carries its own table config in a ``Table config::``
JSON block inside its docstring.  The generator reads those blocks and
assembles the JSON file.
