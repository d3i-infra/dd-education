# Flow completion is generator exhaustion, not an explicit exit

## Decision

Study completion is signaled by generator exhaustion, not an explicit exit: `script.py`'s last yield is a log milestone, the generator returns, and `ScriptWrapper.send()` converts the `StopIteration` into `CommandSystemExit(0, "End of script")`, which the bridge forwards so the host renders its own completion UI (mono's `finished_view`). There is no in-iframe end page.

## Guidance

- Don't yield an explicit exit from `script.py` or `FlowBuilder.start_flow()` — they `return`; only `ScriptWrapper` emits `CommandSystemExit`, so termination has one path.
- Don't add an in-iframe end / "thank you" page: it duplicates the host's completion UI, and a display-only page that holds an unresolved render promise silently blocks the final yield from returning (the EndPage hang).
- `FlowBuilder.start_flow()` returns after one platform — it never ends the study; `script.py` owns the lifecycle and its final act is `emit_log("Study complete")`.
- If a display-only page is ever needed, it must resolve its render promise — never rely on an unresolved promise to hold the UI.
- The education fork's composite module (`platforms/education.py`) is a documented exception, not a counterexample: in education mode `FlowBuilder.start_flow()` `return`s right after the review page, and `education.py` renders `ph.generate_platform_completion_prompt()` — a resolving `PropsUIPromptConfirm`, not an in-iframe end page — before looping back to its menu, needed only because the Pages deployment (ADR-0004) has no host to hand a `CommandSystemExit` to.

## Why

The host marks the task complete and shows its checkmark only on `CommandSystemExit`; anything that blocks the final yield from returning strands the participant — and looks fine in local testing. It happened for real: a "Thank you" EndPage whose render promise nothing resolved hung Python at the last yield, so `StopIteration` never fired and the host never got its exit. Auto-resolving the promise was rejected as a subtle discipline every future display-only page would have to remember; deleting the page removes the failure mode and UI that only duplicated the host's, and matches upstream (which never had an end page). One termination path — ScriptWrapper's conversion — means no ambiguity about who owns the exit.
